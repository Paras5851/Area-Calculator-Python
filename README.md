Area Calculator Using Python:

Overview
The Area Calculator is a Python-based project that allows users to calculate the area of various geometric shapes, such as circles, rectangles, triangles, and more. The program provides an interactive interface where users can input necessary dimensions, and it returns the computed area instantly.

Features
✅ Supports Multiple Shapes – Calculates the area of circles, squares, rectangles, triangles, and other shapes.
✅ User Input Handling – Accepts inputs dynamically and validates incorrect entries.
✅ Mathematical Accuracy – Uses precise formulas for each shape to ensure correct results.
✅ Menu-Driven Interface – Allows users to select different shapes and perform multiple calculations.
✅ Scalability – Can be expanded to include 3D shape volume calculations.

Formulas Used
Circle: π × r²
Rectangle: length × width
Triangle: ½ × base × height
Square: side²

Conclusion
The Python Area Calculator is a simple yet effective project that helps users calculate areas quickly. It is useful for students, engineers, and anyone needing quick area computations. This project can be extended by adding GUI features using Tkinter or PyQt.
